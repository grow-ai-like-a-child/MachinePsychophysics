<h1>Machine Psychophysics</h1>
<h2>Cognitive Control in Vision–Language Models</h2>

<section class="section" id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Human behavior is distinguished by its flexibility and goal-directedness: we can pursue novel, underspecified tasks, adapt to changing contexts, and manage competing objectives over time. At the core of these abilities lies cognitive control...</p>
  <p>Vision-language models (VLMs) can integrate visual and textual information and have demonstrated strong performance on high-level reasoning benchmarks...</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="related-work">
  <h2>Related Work</h2>
  <h3>Human Psychophysics</h3>
  <p>Cognitive control enables the regulation of thought and action in service of internal goals, particularly in situations involving conflict, ambiguity, or distraction...</p>
  <h3>Symbolic and Connectionist Models</h3>
  <p>A longstanding line of research in artificial intelligence has explored how control mechanisms can be embedded within integrated models of cognition...</p>
  <h3>Vision-language Models</h3>
  <p>There has been no prior attempt to directly evaluate the cognitive control capacities of vision-language models (VLMs)...</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="methods">
  <h2>Methods</h2>
  <img src="figure1.png" alt="Stroop and Flanker Tasks">
  <p>To evaluate cognitive control in VLMs, we adapted paradigms from experimental psychology...</p>
  <h3>Classic Conflict Tasks</h3>
  <p>We applied classic cognitive control tasks to evaluate models’ ability to resolve cognitive conflict...</p>
  <h3>Squared Tasks</h3>
  <img src="figure2.png" alt="Squared Tasks">
  <p>In parallel, we adapted the "squared" design introduced by Burgoyne et al...</p>
  <h3>Control Tasks</h3>
  <img src="control_tasks.png" alt="Control Tasks">
  <p>To identify the specific sources of interference in each conflict task, we designed a control battery...</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="results">
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <h3>Standard Tasks</h3>
  <img src="standard_vs_squared.png" alt="Condition Comparison Chart">
  <p>Across all standard tasks, VLMs showed robust congruency effects...</p>
  <h3>Squared Tasks</h3>
  <p>Squared tasks further differentiated models into at-chance performers and those exposing persistent conflict sensitivity...</p>
  <h3>Control Tasks</h3>
  <p>For standard control tasks—where each component process was tested in isolation—models performed at or near ceiling...</p>
  <h3>Scaling and Resources</h3>
  <img src="scaling.png" alt="Scaling Analysis">
  <p>We find a strong correlation between model size and conflict resolution ability...</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="discussion">
  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <h3>Key Findings</h3>
  <p>Our results show that VLMs exhibit human-like congruency effects. More complex squared tasks revealed robust individual differences...</p>
  <h3>Limitations and Future Work</h3>
  <p>Future work could extend this framework to include a broader range of conflict types...</p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="conclusion">
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>We showed that model performance closely aligns with human behavior under resource constraints and reveals robust individual differences...</p>
